# FakeStore E-Commerce App

## Overview

This is a front-end React application that interacts with the [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to simulate an e-commerce experience. Users can view, add, edit, and delete products through API calls. Although responses to POST, PUT, and DELETE requests appear successful, no actual data is changed on the backend—this is a mock API for learning purposes.

## Features

- View product listings from FakeStoreAPI
- View individual product details
- Add a new product using a form
- Edit existing product data
- Delete a product with confirmation
- Navigation bar with routing
- Responsive design using React Bootstrap
- API loading and error handling
